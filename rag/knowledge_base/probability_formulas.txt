Probability Basics:
- P(A∪B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A∩B) (Addition rule)
- P(A∩B) = P(A)×P(B) if A and B are independent
- P(A|B) = P(A∩B) / P(B) (Conditional probability)
- P(Aᶜ) = 1 - P(A) (Complement rule)

Bayes Theorem: P(A|B) = P(B|A)×P(A) / P(B)

Permutations: nPr = n!/(n-r)! 
- Number of ways to arrange r items from n items (order matters)

Combinations: nCr = n!/(r!(n-r)!)
- Number of ways to choose r items from n items (order doesn't matter)

Expected Value: E(X) = Σ(x×P(x)) for discrete random variables
Variance: Var(X) = E(X²) - [E(X)]²
Standard Deviation: σ = √Var(X)

Binomial Distribution: P(X=k) = nCk × pᵏ × (1-p)ⁿ⁻ᵏ
- n trials, probability p of success, k successes
