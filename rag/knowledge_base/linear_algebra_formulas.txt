Matrix Operations:
- Matrix addition: Add corresponding elements
- Matrix multiplication: (AB)ᵢⱼ = Σ(Aᵢₖ × Bₖⱼ)
- Transpose: (Aᵀ)ᵢⱼ = Aⱼᵢ
- Identity matrix: I × A = A × I = A

Determinant (2×2): |A| = ad - bc for A = [[a,b],[c,d]]
Determinant (3×3): Use cofactor expansion

Matrix Inverse: A⁻¹ exists if det(A) ≠ 0
- A × A⁻¹ = A⁻¹ × A = I
- For 2×2: A⁻¹ = (1/det(A)) × [[d,-b],[-c,a]]

System of Linear Equations:
- AX = B can be solved as X = A⁻¹B (if A⁻¹ exists)
- Cramer's rule: xᵢ = det(Aᵢ)/det(A)

Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:
- AV = λV where λ is eigenvalue, V is eigenvector
- Find λ by solving det(A - λI) = 0
